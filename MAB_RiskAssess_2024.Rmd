# Introduction  

*Risk Element Information and Recommendations for Council Consideration*

The Council approved an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) Guidance Document in 2016 which outlined a path forward to more fully incorporate ecosystem considerations into marine fisheries management^[http://www.mafmc.org/s/EAFM_Guidance-Doc_2017-02-07.pdf], and revised the document in February 2019^[http://www.mafmc.org/s/EAFM-Doc-Revised-2019-02-08.pdf]. The Council’s stated goal for EAFM is “to manage for ecologically sustainable utilization of living marine resources while maintaining ecosystem productivity, structure, and function.” Ecologically sustainable utilization is further defined as “utilization that accommodates the needs of present and future generations, while maintaining the integrity, health, and diversity of the marine ecosystem.” Of particular interest to the Council was the development of tools to incorporate the effects of species, fleet, habitat and climate interactions into its management and science programs. To accomplish this, the Council agreed to adopt a structured framework to first prioritize ecosystem interactions, second to specify key questions regarding high priority interactions and third tailor appropriate analyses to address them [@gaichas_framework_2016]. Because there are so many possible ecosystem interactions to consider, a risk assessment was adopted as the first step to identify a subset of high priority interactions [@gaichas_implementing_2018]. The Council completed its first risk assessment in 2017 and the risk elements included in the assessment spanned biological, ecological, social and economic issues (Table \ref{riskel}) and risk criteria for the assessment were based on a range of indicators and expert knowledge (Table \ref{allcriteria}).

The risk assessment was designed to help the Council decide where to focus limited resources to address ecosystem considerations by first clarifying priorities. Overall, the purpose of the EAFM risk assessment is to provide the Council with a proactive strategic planning tool for the sustainable management of marine resources under its jurisdiction, while taking interactions within the ecosystem into account.

Given the length of time since its initial development, the availability of new information and analyses, and ever-changing risks facing Council-managed fisheries, the Council conducted a comprehensive review of the EAFM risk assessment in 2023. The goal of the review was to produce an updated risk assessment that incorporates the latest scientific information, reflects the Council’s current priorities, and can be adaptive and responsive to new and changing conditions that can support a variety of Council management needs. At the conclusion of the review, the Council identified 28 risk elements to be included in the updated assessment – 24 existing elements and 4 new elements. In addition, the Council supported new and/or revised indicators for 16 of the existing risk elements. 

This draft document revises the Mid-Atlantic Council’s EAFM risk assessment and includes the changes approved by the Council as part of its comprehensive review and updates the assessment with the most recent data available, indicators from the 2024 State of the Ecosystem report, and with new analyses conducted by Council and Center staff for relevant risk elements. This report does not include rankings for 3 existing elements and the 4 new elements approved by the Council. Additional time is needed to develop the indicators and risk ranking criteria for these elements. Once developed, this information will be shared with the Council’s Ecosystem and Ocean Planning Committee and Advisory Panel for review and feedback. A final EAFM risk assessment report with information on all 28 risk elements will then be presented to the Council later this year for approval. 

*Components of the EAFM risk assessment*

**Risk Elements** - identify what we are measuring. They can be any aspect that may threaten achieving the biological, economic, or social objectives that the Council desires from a fishery.

**Definitions** - describe why we are measuring it and clearly state what is at risk. In general, because the Council is charged with managing fisheries for Optimum Yield (OY), many risk definitions are centered on a particular element’s potential impact on achieving OY. However, some Risk Elements addressed additional Council objectives (e.g. maximizing fishery value, optimizing employment).

**Indicators** - are how we measure risk and are observations that gives information about the risk element. Indicators may be a time series of data, may come from an individual study, or from qualitative information. 

**Risk Criteria** - help specify what is the risk and include the following risk levels: low, low-moderate, moderate-high, and high. 

**Risk Assessment** - applies the risk criteria to the indicators and summarizes the rationale for the risk ranking.

The risk elements included in the Council’s 2024 updated assessment span biological, ecological, social and economic issues (Table \ref{riskel}) and risk criteria for the assessment were based on a range of indicators and expert knowledge (Table \ref{allcriteria}).

# Risk Assessment

## Ecological Elements

### Stock Assessment Performance

**Description:**

Stock assessments provide the scientific basis for sustainable fishery
management in this region. This risk element is applied at the species
level, and addresses risk to achieving OY due to scientific uncertainty
based on analytical and data limitations. The Council risk policy
accounts for scientific uncertainty in assessments, with methods for
determining scientific uncertainty currently being refined by the
Council's Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC).

Other assessment-related risk elements (F status and B status) describe
risks according to our best understanding of stock status, but
assessment methods and data quality shape that understanding.

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY due to analytical limitations

**Indicators:**

The Council currently uses indicators from stock assessment review and a
qualitative assessment of general assessment data quality. The EOP and
Council can continue to use pass/fail criteria from independent stock
assessment reviews, and more formally incorporate data quality
indicators (including data quality impacts from any source of scientific
survey constraint), assessment retrospective performance indicators, or
other indicators of analytical limitations. The SSC OFL CV process
already reviews many aspects of analytical assessment uncertainty,
including data quality and retrospective performance, which may be
incorporated in this EAFM risk assessment.

**Proposed risk criteria:**

Low risk for assessment performance was defined as stock assessment
model(s) passing peer review, and stocks having high data quality.
Low-Moderate risk was assessment passing peer review, but some key data
and/or reference points are lacking. The Moderate-High risk category was
not used for this element in the past, but could include consideration
of major data gaps and or large retrospective patterns that require
adjustment. High risk was the assessment failing peer review, and/or
that considerable data shortcomings required the use of data-limited
tools.

An alternative set of criteria could apply OFL CVs used by the SSC for
establishing ABC, which represent overall assessment uncertainty. An OFL
CV of 60% could represent the low risk category, 100% the low-moderate
risk category, 150% the moderate-high risk category, and stocks without
an assessment (where OFL CV is usually not applied) remaining in the
high risk category. If applying these criteria, we could change the name
of this to "Assessment uncertainty" to match what the SSC is evaluating.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             Assessment model(s) passed peer review, high data
                  quality, small retrospective pattern

  Low-Moderate    Assessment passed peer review but some data and/or
                  reference points may be lacking

  Moderate-High   Assessment passed peer review but with major data
                  quality issue or large retrospective pattern

  High            Assessment failed peer review or no assessment,
                  data-limited tools applied

### Fishing Mortality Status and Stock Biomass Status

**Description:**

Managed fisheries are required to be prosecuted within fishing mortality
limits and managed stocks are required to be maintained above minimum
threshold biomass levels to preserve sustainable yield. These elements
are applied at the species level. Because OY is the objective, and OY is
at most MSY under U.S. law, fishing mortality ($F$) limit reference
points are based on $F_{MSY}$, while the stock biomass ($B$) target is
biomass at MSY ($B_{MSY}$). $F$ and $B$ status relative to established
MSY-based target and limit reference points or proxies (Gabriel and
Mace, 1999) from stock assessments therefore indicate the level of risk
to achieving OY from either overfishing or stock depletion,
respectively.

**Definitions:**

Fishing Mortality -- F Status: Risk of not achieving OY due to
overfishing

Stock Biomass -- B Status: Risk of not achieving OY due to depleted
stock

**Indicators:**

Stock assessments estimate both current F relative to the F reference
point and current B relative to the B reference point and these
indicators are used directly. When these quantities are not estimated
due to analytical limitations, the SSC can evaluate the weight of
evidence for risk of overfishing and overfished status based on evidence
outside the stock assessment, and this evaluation is used in the EAFM
risk assessment.

```{r stock-status, fig.width = 7.5,  fig.asp = 0.5, fig.cap = "Summary of single species status for MAFMC and jointly federally managed stocks (Spiny dogfish and both Goosefish). The dotted vertical line is the target biomass reference point of $B_{MSY}$. The dashed lines are the management thresholds of one half $B_{MSY}$ (vertical) or $F_{MSY}$. (horizontal). Stocks in orange are below the biomass threshold (overfished) or have fishing mortality above the limit (subject to overfishing), so are not meeting objectives. Stocks in purple  are above the biomass threshold but below the biomass target with fishing mortality within the limit. Stocks in green are above the biomass target, with fishing mortality within the limit."}

# code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-stock-status.R"), 

a <- ecodata::plot_stock_status(report = "MidAtlantic")

#+
#  ggplot2::annotation_custom(gridExtra::tableGrob(a$unknown,
#                             theme = gridExtra::ttheme_default(base_size = 7), 
#                             rows=NULL), 
#                             xmin=0.8, xmax=1.8, ymin=1.5, ymax=2)

```

**Proposed risk criteria:**

We applied low and high risk criteria for these elements as defined in
U.S. law. Low risk criteria are $F$ \< $F_{MSY}$ and $B$ \> $B_{MSY}$
for an individual stock. High risk criteria are $F$ \> $F_{MSY}$ and $B$
\< 0.5 $B_{MSY}$ for an individual stock. The Council established the
intermediate risk categories to address stocks with unknown status.
Moderate-high risk was defined as unknown status in the absence of other
information for both $F$ and $B$. Low-moderate risk was defined as
unknown status, but with a weight of evidence indicating low overfishing
risk for $F$. Similarly, low-moderate risk for $B$ was either 0.5
$B_{MSY}$ \< $B$ \< $B_{MSY}$ or unknown status, but with a weight of
evidence indicating low risk that the population is depleted.

  Low             F \< Fmsy

  Low-Moderate    Unknown, but weight of evidence indicates low

### Food Web (1) - Prey Availability

**Description:**

This element is applied at the species level.

Fish stocks and protected species stocks are managed using single
species approaches, but fish and protected species stocks exist within a
food web of predator and prey interactions. This element is one of two
separating food web risks to achieving OY for Council managed species
from two sources. This first element assesses prey availability for each
species, and the second food web risk element assesses predation
pressure on each species (see next element).

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY for Council managed species due to availability
of prey.

**Indicators:**

Indicators of prey availability for each Council managed species would
be based on food habits information for the Council managed species
combined with population trends for key prey species (if available).
Prey could include all species (Council managed, other-managed, and
non-managed) or a subset as determined by the EOP and Council.

Another indicator of prey could be based on stomach contents of
predators, as was used for the 2022 bluefish research track assessment
and presented in the 2023 State of the Ecosystem report. This index
includes 22 forage species and was designed for bluefish, but also
includes important forage for summer flounder and other Council managed
species.

```{r foragebio, fig.cap = "Forage fish index in the MAB for spring (blue) and fall (red) surveys, with a decline (purple) in fall. Index values are relative to the maximum observation within a region across surveys.", fig.asp=.6}
#, code=readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna_MAB.Rmd-forage-index.R")

ecodata::plot_forage_index()
```

A secondary indicator of prey availability would include the fish
condition indicators from the State of the Ecosystem report (shown below
under Ecosystem Productivity). These would not rely on detailed diet
information, instead reflecting the impact of environmental drivers
including prey availability on fish growth.

Diet information was gathered from the Northeast Fisheries Science
Center (NEFSC) food habits database and other sources (Smith and Link,
2010; Johnson et al 2008).

**Potential risk criteria:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             Prey availability high (not limiting) and/or good fish
                  condition past 5 years

  Low-Moderate    Aggregate prey available for this species has stable or
                  increasing trend, moderate condition

  Moderate-High   Aggregate prey available for this species has
                  significant decreasing trend, poor condition

  High            Managed species highly dependent on prey with limited
                  and declining availability, poor condition
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Food Web (2) - Predation Pressure

**Description:**

This element is applied at the species level.

Fish stocks and protected species stocks are managed using single
species approaches, but fish and protected species stocks exist within a
food web of predator and prey interactions. This element is one of two
separating food web risks to achieving OY for Council managed species
from two sources. This second food web risk element assesses predation
pressure on each species, and the first element assesses prey
availability for each species (see element above).

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY for Council managed species due to predation
pressure.

**Indicators:**

Indicators of predation pressure on a Council managed species would be
based on food habits information for predators of the species combined
with key predator trends. This could be derived from empirical
information or food web/multispecies models. Predators could include all
species (protected, HMS, Council managed, other-managed, and unmanaged)
or a subset as determined by the EOP and Council. Predation mortality
(M2) compared to fishing mortality (F) to evaluate the relative
importance of predation mortality is another indicator that could help
inform the risk criteria levels.

**Potential risk criteria:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             Predation pressure represents low proportion of overall
                  mortality

  Low-Moderate    Predation pressure moderate proportion of overall
                  mortality, decreasing mortality trend

  Moderate-High   Predation pressure moderate proportion of overall
                  mortality, increasing mortality trend

  High            Predation pressure represents high proportion of
                  overall mortality, increasing mortality trend
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Food Web (3) - Protected Species Prey

**Description:**

This element is applied at the species level.

Fish stocks and protected species stocks are managed using single
species approaches, but fish and protected species stocks exist within a
food web of predator and prey interactions. The previous two elements
focus on Council managed species OY, while this element focuses on
protected species objectives (maintain or recover populations and
minimize bycatch).

This element ranks the risks of not achieving protected species
objectives due to species interactions with Council managed species. In
the US, protected species include marine mammals (under the Marine
Mammal Protection Act), Endangered and Threatened species (under the
Endangered Species Act), and migratory birds (under the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act). In the Northeast US, endangered/threatened species include
Atlantic salmon, Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon, all sea turtle
species, and five whales.

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving protected species objectives due to interactions
with Council-managed species

**Indicators:**

Food web models and diet information can be used to establish thresholds
of "importance" for predators and prey. Although monkfish occasionally
ingest seabirds (Perry et al., 2013), there are no Council-managed
species that are important predators of protected species (Smith and
Link, 2010), so here we rank only risks where Council managed species
represent prey of protected species. An important prey of protected
species is defined here as individually comprising \>30% of the
predator's diet by weight. Critical prey warranting a high risk ranking
would be a majority (\>50%) of diet for an individual protected species.

**Potential risk criteria:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             Few interactions with any protected species

  Low-Moderate    Important prey of 1-2 protected species, or important
                  prey of 3 or more protected species with management
                  consideration of interaction

  Moderate-High   Important prey of 3 or more protected species

  High            Managed species is sole prey for a protected species

### Ecosystem Productivity

**Description:**

This element is applied at the ecosystem level (the Mid-Atlantic
Ecosystem Production Unit).

Productivity at the base of the food web supports and ultimately limits
the amount of managed species production in an ecosystem.

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY due to changing system productivity at the base
of the food web.

**Indicators:**

A combination of five indicators will be used to assess the risk of
changing ecosystem productivity. We examine trends in total primary
production, zooplankton abundance for a key Mid-Atlantic species,
aggregate forage fish (new), and two aggregate fish productivity
measures: condition factor (weight divided by length of individual fish)
and a survey based "recruitment" (small fish to large fish) index. An
assessment-based recruitment index was recently added to the State of
the Ecosystem report as well. Because benthic crustaceans are important
prey for many Council-managed species, we note a benthic production
indicator is desirable but not yet available.

These indicators evaluate ecosystem productivity in aggregate, which may
change due to drivers such as decreasing primary productivity, changes
in spatial/temporal overlap at the base of the food web, or other
factors.

For primary production and fish productivity, the spatial scale of
analysis is the Mid-Atlantic Ecosystem Production Unit.

#### Primary production

Primary production has fluctuated recently with current conditions near
average. The observed stability in system productivity is in contrast to
an apparent shift in the timing of the bloom cycle in the Mid-Atlantic.
Comparing remote sensing information from the 1970-80s to 1997-2015
information suggests that winter productivity was historically higher in
the MAB and that the spring bloom we see today was less prominent.
Shifts in timing of low trophic level production can affect Council
managed fish species through early life history stages that feed on
zooplankton.

```{r, fig.cap="Monthly primary production trends show the annual cycle (i.e. the peak during the summer months) and the changes over time for each month.", fig.width=9, fig.asp=.8}
ecodata::plot_chl_pp(varName = "pp", plottype = "monthly")
```

#### Zooplankton abundance

Zooplankton provide a critical link between phytoplankton at the base of
the food web, and higher trophic organisms such as fish, mammals, and
birds. Changes in the species composition and biomass of the zooplankton
community have a great potential to affect recruitment success and
fisheries productivity, and climate change may be the most important
pathway for these changes to manifest. Therefore these indices are
relevant to both productivity and trophic structure objectives.

The time series of zooplankton biovolume suggest that overall
zooplankton production has not changed over time. However, the dominant
species of zooplankton in the Mid-Atlantic, *Centropages typicus*, shows
a seasonal shift in abundance. This suggests a change in timing of
zooplankton reproductive cycles, which may impact fish species such as
Atlantic mackerel.

```{r zoopanom, fig.cap="Changes in zooplankton abundance in the MAB for large (top left) and small (top right) copepods, Cnidarians (bottom left), and Euphausiids (bottom right), with significant increases (orange) in small copeods and Cnidarians.", fig.width=5, fig.asp=.8}
a <- ecodata::plot_zoo_abundance_anom(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "copepod") + 
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~EPU~Var, labeller = labeller(EPU = function(x) {rep("", length(x))}))
b <- ecodata::plot_zoo_abundance_anom(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "euphausid") + 
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~EPU~Var, labeller = labeller(EPU = function(x) {rep("", length(x))}))

a/b

```

#### Forage Base - new indicator

The amount of forage available is one important driver of fish
productivity. Indicators of aggregate pelagic forage fish biomass and
forage fish energy content are presented in the State of the Ecosystem
report. Indicators of benthic forage are under development but not yet
available. Food habits data from surveys and literature could be used to
define the forage base common to all Council managed and protected
species.



#### Fish condition

Fish condition is measured as the weight per length--a measure of
"fatness". This information is from NEFSC bottom trawl surveys and shows
a change in condition across all species at around 2000. Around
2010-2013 many species started to have better condition, though black
sea bass remain thinner for their length on average.

```{r mab-cf, fig.cap = "Condition factor for fish species in the MAB based on fall NEFSC bottom trawl survey data. MAB data are missing for 2017 due to survey delays, and no survey was conducted in 2020.", fig.width=9}

ecodata::plot_condition() +
  theme(#legend.position = 'bottom',
        legend.text = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 11),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 12))
```

#### Fish productivity

The number of small fish relative to the biomass of larger fish of the

productivity intended to complement model-based stock assessment

**Potential risk criteria:**

Low risk for this element was defined as no trends in ecosystem
productivity across all five indicators. The Low-Moderate risk criterion
was trend(s) in ecosystem productivity for 1-2 indicators, whether
increasing or decreasing. The Moderate-High risk criterion was trends in
ecosystem productivity (3+ measures, increase or decrease). The High
risk criterion was decreasing trends across 4 or more indicators.

### Climate

**Description:**

Climate change is expected to alter environmental conditions for managed
fish in the Northeast US. This element is applied at the species level,
and evaluates risks to species productivity (and therefore to achieving
OY) due to projected climate change factors in the region using a
comprehensive assessment (Hare et al., 2016) and other climate
indicators (e.g., Mid-Atlantic ocean acidification).

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY due to projected climate change or ocean
acidification impacts on species productivity.

**Indicators:**

Indicators for climate productivity risk were taken from a climate
vulnerability assessment (Hare et al., 2016) that evaluated exposure of
each species to multiple climate threats, including ocean and air
temperature, ocean acidification, ocean salinity, ocean currents,
precipitation, and sea level rise. The assessment also evaluated the
sensitivity (*not extinction risk*) of each species based on habitat and
prey specificity, sensitivity to temperature and ocean acidification,
multiple life history factors, and number of non-climate stressors.
Additional indicators linking temperature and ocean acidification to
individual stocks are presented in the State of the Ecosystem reports.

### Distribution Shifts

**Description:**

Climate change is expected to drive changes in spatial distribution for
managed fish in the Northeast US as environmental conditions become more
or less favorable for each stock throughout its range. Species
distribution shifts in turn can increase risks of ineffective spatial
catch allocation; if catch allocation is greatly mismatched with species
distribution OY may not be achieved. This element is applied at the
species level, and evaluates risks of species distribution shifts due to
projected climate change in the Northeast US.

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY due to spatial mismatch of stocks and
management as a result of climate-driven distribution shifts.

**Indicators:**

Risks of species distribution shifts due to projected climate change in
the Northeast US were assessed in a comprehensive assessment (Hare et
al., 2016). We applied those distribution shift risk rankings directly
in the risk assessment.

```{r, fig.cap="Hare et al., 2016 Distribution shift risk by species, Northeast US"}
magick::image_read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/presentations/master/docs/EDAB_images/NEVAshiftmid.png")

```

In addition, changes in species distribution are monitored using
fisheries independent bottom trawl surveys. Two distribution shift
indicators are derived from these surveys: kernel density plots of
recent distribution compared with 1970s distribution, and time series of
the along shelf position of the center of distribution.

*Historical vs.current distribution*

Spatial distribution has changed over time for some species more than
for others. The distribution of black sea bass, as measured by NEFSC
surveys, has shifted northward relative to historical distributions. In
contrast, the distribution of longfin squid in the Mid-Atlantic has
remained relatively stable.

Species distribution models incorporating habitat variables show where
distributions have increased or decreased over time:
[[https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/ecosystems/fisheries-habitat-northeast-us-shelf-ecosystem]{.underline}](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/ecosystems/fisheries-habitat-northeast-us-shelf-ecosystem#atlantic-mackerel)

*Changes in along shelf position*

The annual centroid of a species' distribution can be characterized by
the position in the ecosystem along an axis oriented from the southwest
to the northeast, referred to as the along shelf distance, and by depth.
Along shelf distances range from 0 to 1360 km, which relates to
positions along the axis from the origin in the southwest to the
northeast. All species combined show a shift to the northeast and into
deeper water. Individual Council managed species distribution
centeroids, aside from squids, also showed this trend to the northeast
along the shelf in previous analysis.

```{r species-dist, fig.cap = "Aggregate species distribution metrics for species in the Northeast Large Marine Ecosystem: along shelf distance with increasing trend (orange), and depth with decreasing trend indicating deeper water (purple).", fig.width = 8, fig.asp=0.3}

### Estuarine and Coastal Habitat

**Description:**

Estuarine and coastal habitat provides important nursery grounds for
Council managed species, and is changing in quality and quantity due to
multiple stressors from climate, land use, and coastal development. This
element is applied at the species level, and evaluates risk of not
achieving OY due to threats to estuarine and nearshore coastal
habitat/nursery grounds.

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY due to threats to estuarine/nursery habitat.

**Indicators:**

Risk was determined by first evaluating the estuarine dependence of
species, and then by enumerating threats to the estuarine habitat
required by these species. An assessment of national coastal and
estuarine condition was used in this assessment. Water and habitat
quality assessments produced for Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, Long
Island Sound, and other coastal estuaries have been developed and can be
considered in the future. The National Coastal Condition Assessment for
the Northeast US (US EPA, 2012) was used to evaluate estuarine and
coastal condition. This report lists water, sediment, benthic, and
coastal habitat quality as well as fish contamination. State of the
Ecosystem reports now include up to date indicators of Chesapeake Bay
habitat conditions which could be included as indicators.

```{r, fig.cap="Chesapeake Bay water quality trend, 3 year running mean proportion of areas meeting or exceeding quality thresholds based on dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, water clarity, and submerged aquatic vegetation."}
ecodata::plot_ches_bay_wq()
```

Species specific habitat use indicators for Chesapeake Bay are in
development. As reported in the 2023 SOE, Chesapeake Bay suitable
habitat for juvenile summer flounder growth has declined by 50% or more.
Climate change is expected to continue impacting habitat function and
use for multiple species. Habitat is improving in some areas (tidal
fresh SAV, oyster reefs), but eelgrass is declining. Similar information
from multiple East Coast estuaries could be integrated into the risk
assessment as it becomes available.

**Potential risk criteria:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             Not dependent on nearshore coastal or estuarine habitat

  Low-Moderate    Estuarine dependent, estuarine condition stable

  Moderate-High   Estuarine dependent, estuarine condition fair

  High            Estuarine dependent, estuarine condition poor
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Species were defined as low risk if not dependent on nearshore coastal
or estuarine habitat. Low-Moderate risk were estuarine dependent species
with a stable estuarine condition. Moderate-High risk were estuarine
dependent species with a fair estuarine condition. High risk were
estuarine dependent species with a poor estuarine condition.

### Offshore Habitat (new)

**Description:**

This element would be applied at the species level.

Offshore habitat , defined here as all habitat outside of the estuary
and beyond the immediate coastal/nearshore areas, supports all life
stages of many Council managed species, and is changing in quality and
quantity due to multiple stressors from climate to other ocean uses such
as offshore wind development. This element evaluates risk of achieving
OY due to changes in offshore habitat quality and quantity.

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY due to changing offshore habitat. The rationale
is that multiple drivers of offshore habitat change, including ocean
industrialization, are included in this definition.

**Indicators:**

Indicators of offshore habitat trends are available from
species-specific habitat modeling through the [[Northeast Regional
Habitat
Assessment]{.underline}](https://nrha.shinyapps.io/dataexplorer/#!/),
[[NEFSC]{.underline}](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/ecosystems/fisheries-habitat-northeast-us-shelf-ecosystem),
and multiple other efforts throughout the region.

Indicators include the amount of habitat, quality of habitat, or other
aspects of habitat important to support fish productivity. For example,
the cold pool is a seasonal habitat feature linked to several species in
the Mid-Atlantic with indicators for spatial extent, duration, and
temperature within the feature.

**Potential risk criteria:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             No trends in offshore habitat

  Low-Moderate    Trend in offshore habitat (1-2 measures, increase or
                  decrease)

  Moderate-High   Trend in offshore habitat (3+ measures, increase or
                  decrease)

  High            Decreasing trend in offshore habitat, 4+ measures

## Economic Elements

### Commercial Value

**Description:**

This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and addresses the risk
of not maximizing fishery value. Revenue serves as a proxy for
commercial profits, which is the component of a fishery's value that
this element is ultimately attempting to assess risk towards. Lack of
cost information across all fleet segments precludes the assessment of
risk to profitability itself at the ecosystem level.

**Definition:**

Risk of not maximizing commercial fishery value.

**Indicators:**

Gross revenue is the current indicator for this element, and can be
developed for all fishing activity within the Mid-Atlantic and for all
Council managed species. Revenue serves as a proxy for commercial
profits, which is the component of a fishery's value that this element
is ultimately attempting to assess risk towards. Currently this
indicator is aggregated and presented at the ecosystem-level.

```{r comm-revenue, fig.width = 6, fig.asp = 0.45, fig.cap = "Revenue for the for the Mid-Atlantic region: total (black) and from MAFMC managed species (red), with a significant decrease (purple) for total revenue."}
#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-comdat-comm-revenue.R")

ecodata::plot_comdat(report="MidAtlantic", varName="revenue") + 
  ggplot2::theme(legend.position = "right",
                      legend.title = ggplot2::element_blank())

```

Net revenue (Gross revenue - trip costs) is a better proxy for trip
value, in an economic context. However, this metric can be calculated
only for trips by vessels holding federal licenses and submitting Vessel
Trip Reports. This indicator would thus not capture all fishing within
the region, and of potential interest to the Council. It underrepresents
the total revenue generated regionally by about ½, and does not present
the same trends as the subset for which net revenue can be generated.
See figure below for the comparison of all revenue from Hatteras to the
Canadian border versus what net revenue can be calculated for. The
Ecosystem and Ocean Planning Committee and Advisory Panel recommended
continued development of this indicator.

```{r, fig.cap="Cost coverage"}
magick::image_read("https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/presentations/raw/master/docs/EDAB_images/Cost_Coverage.png")
```

**Potential risk criteria:**

Low risk was defined as no trend and low variability in revenue.
Low-Moderate risk was increasing or overall high variability in revenue.
Moderate-High risk was a significant long-term revenue decrease. High
risk was a significant recent decrease in revenue.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             No trend and low variability in revenue

  Low-Moderate    Increasing or high variability in revenue

  Moderate-High   Significant long term revenue decrease

  High            Significant recent decrease in revenue

### Marine Recreational Angler Days/Trips

**Description:**

Providing recreational opportunities is a stated goal of optimal fishery
management under the legal definition of "benefits to the nation".
Recreational fishing is important in the Mid-Atlantic region with the
economic and social aspects of many coastal communities being highly
dependent on recreational fishing.

This element is assessed at the ecosystem level where it applies equally
to all recreationally fished species. Providing recreational
opportunities is a stated goal of optimal fishery management under the
legal definition of "benefits to the nation". Recreational fishing is
important in the Mid-Atlantic region with the economic and social
aspects of many coastal communities being highly dependent on
recreational fishing.

**Definition:**

Risk of not maximizing recreational fishery value and opportunities.

**Indicators:**

Currently, angler days and trips are the proxy indicators for the value
generated from recreational fishing. Although willingness to pay would
better capture the economic concept of recreational value, this
information is not gathered systematically in the region. Potentially,
multiple indicators could be used to better proxy for recreational
fishery value.

```{r rec-op, fig.cap = "Recreational effort (number of trips, black) in the Mid-Atlantic, with significant increase (orange line)."}
# code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-recdat-effort.R")

ecodata::plot_recdat(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "effort")

**Potential risk criteria:**

Angler days and trips are the proxy indicators for the value generated
from recreational fishing.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             No trends in angler days/trips

  Low-Moderate    Increasing or high variability in angler days/trips

### Commercial Fishery Resilience (1) - Revenue Diversity

**Description:**

This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and addresses the
potential risk of reduced commercial fishery business resilience by
evaluating species diversity of revenue at the permit level.

**Definition:**

Commercial Fishery Resilience (Species Revenue Diversity) - Risk of
reduced commercial fishery business resilience (at permit level).

**Indicators:**

Currently the average effective Shannon index for species revenue at the
permit level is used to calculate diversity for all permits landing any
amount of Council-managed species within a year (including both monkfish
and spiny dogfish). Although the exact value of the effective Shannon
index is relatively uninformative in this context, the relative value
identifies changes in diversity.

```{r commercial-div-species-div,  fig.cap = paste0("Species revenue diversity in the Mid Atlantic.")}
#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-commercial-div-species-div.R")

ecodata::plot_commercial_div(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "Permit revenue species diversity")
```


Although the Shannon index provides a measure proportional to each
type's relative frequency, the effective Shannon index has the added
benefit of converting diversity measures onto a common scale, which is
important when averaging across permits after calculation. As such, the
effective Shannon index was selected as the preferred index of fishing
diversity, consistent with the literature (Thunberg & Correia 2015).

**Potential risk criteria:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             No trend in diversity measure

  Low-Moderate    Increasing trend or high variance in diversity measure

  Moderate-High   Significant long term downward trend in diversity
                  measure

  High            Significant recent downward trend in diversity measure
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Low risk was defined as no trend and low variability in the diversity
measure. Low-Moderate risk was an increasing trend or overall high
variance in the diversity measure. Moderate-High risk was a significant
long term decrease in the diversity measure. High risk was a significant
recent decrease in the diversity measure.

### Commercial Fishery Resilience (2) - Shoreside Support

**Description:**

This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and ranks the risk of
reduced commercial fishery business resilience due to shoreside support
infrastructure by examining the number of shoreside support businesses.

**Definition:**

Risk of reduced commercial fishery business resilience due to loss of
shoreside support infrastructure.

**Indicators:**

Indicators include the number of shoreside support businesses. The
number of shoreside support businesses were tallied for all Mid-Atlantic
states in two categories: number of companies (Quarterly Census of
Employment and Wages. Obtained September 27, 2017. US Department of
Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. <https://www.bls.gov/cew/home.htm>)
and number of non-employer entities Non-employer Statistics." Obtained
September 28, 2017. U.S. Census Bureau.
<https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nonemployer-statistics.html>),
which we consider separately. Non-employer entities are businesses that
have no paid employees (i.e. entrepreneurs, or the owner is the
workforce), while the shoreside support companies include all businesses
with paid employees. Some state level data was not included due to
confidentiality.

The number of shoreside support companies include seafood merchant
wholesalers, seafood product preparation and packaging, and seafood
markets across all Mid-Atlantic states. The indicator shows a
significant long-term and short-term decrease, which represents
moderate-high risk to fishery resilience. The number of non-employer
entities, including seafood preparation and packaging and seafood
markets, shows a long-term increase. Data from other shoreside fishery
supporting businesses, such as gear manufacturers and welding companies,
are not included here due to aggregation of the statistics across
non-fishing industries (e.g. net manufacturers combined with all other
businesses).

**Potential risk criteria:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             No trend in shoreside support businesses

  Low-Moderate    Increasing or high variability in shoreside support
                  businesses

  Moderate-High   Significant recent decrease in one measure of shoreside
                  support businesses

  High            Significant recent decrease in multiple measures of
                  shoreside support businesses

## Social-Cultural Elements

### Commercial Fishery Resilience (3) -- Fleet Diversity

**Description:**

This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and ranks the risk to
maintaining equity in access to fishery resources. Beyond equity
concerns, maintaining diversity can provide the capacity to adapt to
change at the ecosystem level for dependent fishing communities, and can
address objectives related to stability.

**Definition:**

Risk of reduced fishery resilience (number and diversity of fleets).

**Indicators:**

Currently the diversity in revenue generated by different fleet
segments, as well as a count of the number of active fleets, at the
ecosystem level. A fleet is defined here as the combination of gear
(Scallop Dredge, Other Dredge, Gillnet, Hand Gear, Longline, Bottom
Trawl, Midwater Trawl, Pot, Purse Seine, or Clam Dredge) and vessel
length category (Less than 30 ft, 30 to 50 ft, 50 to 75 feet, 75 ft and
above). The effective Shannon index is used to calculate the diversity
of revenue across these fleets. Although the exact value of the
effective Shannon index is relatively uninformative in this context, the
relative value identifies changes in diversity.

```{r commercial-div,  fig.cap = paste0("Commercialfleet  diversity in the Mid Atlantic.")}
#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-commercial-div-species-div.R")

ecodata::plot_commercial_div(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "Fleet count")
```
Other metrics for diversity exist. The Simpson index is a common measure
of biodiversity, but has the undesirable attribute of being asymmetric
and weighing more common types more heavily than the less common types.
Although the Shannon index provides a measure proportional to each
type's relative frequency, the effective Shannon index has the added
benefit of converting diversity measures onto a common scale. As such,
the effective Shannon index was selected as the preferred index of
fishing diversity, consistent with the literature and ensuring no
differential treatment between large and small fleets (Thunberg &
Correia 2015).

**Potential risk criteria:**

Low risk was defined as no trend and low variability in the diversity
measure. Low-Moderate risk was increasing variability or overall high
variability in the diversity measure. Moderate-High risk was a
significant long-term decrease in the diversity measure. High risk was a
significant recent decrease in the diversity measure.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*

### Recreational Fleet Diversity (new)

**Description:**

This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and ranks the risk to
maintaining equity in recreational access to fishery resources. Beyond
equity concerns, maintaining diversity can provide the capacity to adapt
to change at the ecosystem level for dependent fishing communities, and
can address objectives related to stability.

**Definition:**

Risk of reduced recreational fishery business resilience (diversity of
modes).

**Indicators:**

Recreational fleet effort diversity is already presented in the
Mid-Atlantic State of the Ecosystem Report. This indicator is an
effective Shannon estimate of diversity of effort across mode
(i.e. effort by shoreside, private boat, and for-hire anglers).

```{r rec-div, fig.cap = "Recreational fleet effort diversity (black) in the Mid-Atlantic, with significant decrease (purple line)."}
#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-recdat-diversity.R")

ecodata::plot_recdat(report = "MidAtlantic", varName = "effortdiversity")
```

Other metrics for diversity exist. The Simpson index is a common measure
of biodiversity, but has the undesirable attribute of being asymmetric
and weighing more common types more heavily than the less common types.
Although the Shannon index provides a measure proportional to each
type's relative frequency, the effective Shannon index has the added
benefit of converting diversity measures onto a common scale. As such,
the effective Shannon index was selected as the preferred index of
fishing diversity, consistent with the literature and ensuring no
differential treatment between large and small mode contributions
(Thunberg & Correia 2015).

The Ecosystem and Ocean Planning Committee and AP also recommended a
harvest:catch ratio by mode indicator. The intent of this indicator
would be to evaluate if recreational fishing behavior/preferences are
changing (i.e., harvest versus catch and release) within the different
recreational modes/sectors.

**Potential risk criteria:**

Similar criteria could be applied as for commercial diversity. Low risk
was defined as no trend and low variability in the diversity measure.
Low-Moderate risk was increasing variability or overall high variability
in the diversity measure. Moderate-High risk was a significant long-term
decrease in the diversity measure. High risk was a significant recent
decrease in the diversity measure.

## Fishing Community Vulnerability

**Description:**

This element ranks the vulnerability of communities to events such as
regulatory changes to fisheries, wind farms, and other ocean-based
businesses, as well as to natural hazards, disasters, and climate
change. Vulnerability metrics can help assess the relative impact of
system changes on human communities dependent on and engaged in fishing
activities.

This element is applied at the ecosystem level.

**Definition:**

Risk of reduced community resilience (vulnerability, reliance,
engagement).

**Indicators:**

The NOAA Fisheries Community Social Vulnerability Indicators (CSVIs;
Jepson and Colburn (2013)) are statistical measures of the vulnerability
of communities to events such as regulatory changes to fisheries, wind
farms, and other ocean-based businesses, as well as to natural hazards,
disasters, and climate change. The CSVIs currently serve as indicators
of social vulnerability, gentrification pressure vulnerability,
commercial and recreational fishing dependence (with dependence being a
function of both reliance and engagement), sea level rise risk, species
vulnerability to climate change, and catch composition diversity. We use
a combination of these five indicators for the most fishery dependent
communities to evaluate overall social risk levels.

  Low             Few (\<10%) vulnerable fishery dependent communities

  Low-Moderate    10-25% of fishery dependent communities with \>3 high
                  vulnerability ratings

  Moderate-High   25-50% of fishery dependent communities with \>3 high
                  vulnerability ratings

  High            Majority (\>50%) of fishery dependent communities with
                  \>3 high vulnerability ratings
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a brief description for each vulnerability category based on
the NOAA social indicator study (Colburn et al., 2016; Jepson and
Colburn, 2013):

-   **Fishing dependence** indices portray the importance or level of
    dependence of commercial or recreational fishing to coastal
    communities.

-   **Social vulnerability** indices represent social factors that can
    shape either an individual or community's ability to adapt to
    change. These factors exist within all communities regardless of the
    importance of fishing.

-   **Gentrification pressure** indices characterize those factors that,
    over time may indicate a threat to commercial or recreational
    working waterfront, including infrastructure.

Here, we define gentrification in fishing communities as described by
Colburn and Jepson (2012), where coastal population growth combined with
an influx of higher-income people seeking waterfront property can
increase property values and displace working-class residents engaged in
resource-dependent activities. "Three common elements of gentrification
are reuse of waterfront structures, construction of new housing, and
growth within the services sector (Colburn and Jepson, 2012)."

Communities are ranked as high, medium high, moderate, or low relative
to the respective indicator. Community dependence on commercial and
recreational fishing is mixed, with notably more communities in the
Mid-Atlantic dependent on recreational fishing. While communities with
high to medium high risk for social vulnerability are broadly
distributed in suburban and rural areas of the Mid-Atlantic region,
communities with high to medium high gentrification pressure are
concentrated in beachfront communities near urban areas in New York and
New Jersey.

The social and economic impacts of climate change have been modeled
through application of social indicators of fishing dependent
communities (Jepson and Colburn, 2013). Assessment of a range of social
indicators has been applied in the Mid-Atlantic Region to predict
vulnerability of communities to regulatory changes and disasters. More
recently this methodology has been extended to include specific
indicators of vulnerability to climate change and linked to species
vulnerability assessments (Colburn et al., 2016; Hare et al., 2016). The
tools developed through this approach are vital to an evaluation of the
risks of climate change facing coastal communities dependent on fishing.
Below is a description of the CSVIs related to climate change.

-   **Sea level rise index** is a measure of the overall risk of
    inundation from sea level rise based on community area lost from one
    to six foot level projections over the next \~90 years. A high rank
    indicates a community more vulnerable to sea level rise.

-   **Species vulnerability** is measured by the proportion of community
    fish landings that attributed to species vulnerable to climate
    change.

-   **Catch composition diversity** is the relative abundance of species
    landed in a community. It is measured by Simpson's Reciprocal Index,
    and a higher index value indicates greater diversity. Communities
    with a diverse array of species landed may be less vulnerable to
    climate change.

Sea level rise is predicted to have variable impacts on coastal
communities. The Mid-Atlantic region has a 3-4 times higher than global
average sea level rise rate (Sallenger et al. 2012). Mid-Atlantic
communities clustered around the Chesapeake Bay area and the New Jersey
shore had especially high vulnerability to sea level rise (Fig. ). These
vulnerabilities include infrastructure (docks, marinas, bait shops, gear
storage) and access to shore-based facilities due realignment of coastal
communities.

Mid-Atlantic fishing communities with total landings value of \$100,000
or more were mapped for their dependence on species vulnerable to
climate change and catch composition diversity (Simpson Reciprocal
Index). A number of communities in southern New Jersey, Maryland and
Virginia are highly dependent on species such as clams that are highly
vulnerable to climate change while displaying low catch composition
diversity. Communities with this situation are considered more
vulnerable to climate change in general.

While the maps provide an overview of the social and climate indicator
results for the Mid-Atlantic coastal communities, Table identifies
Mid-Atlantic communities that are most highly dependent on both
commercial and recreational fishing. The varying vulnerability level to
social factors, gentrification pressure, and climate change in these
communities provide a more comprehensive profile and should be taken
into account in the decision making process for fishery management.

To estimate "high" vulnerability across all current indicators (which
are ranked on different scales), we tallied rankings from Table of
MedHigh or High for social vulnerability and gentrification pressure,
along with rankings of High risk from sea level rise, High/Very High
species vulnerability, and rankings of Low catch composition diversity.
We considered a majority (3 or more out 5) to represent high risk to a
community overall because with only 5 indicators, this means that a
majority (60-100%) of the individual indicators were high risk. Low risk
ranking was defined as few (\<10%) vulnerable fishery dependent
communities with 3 or more high vulnerability rating. Low-Moderate risk
was 10-25% of fishery dependent communities with 3 or more high
vulnerability ratings. Moderate-High risk was 25-50% of fishery
dependent communities with 3 or more high vulnerability ratings. High
risk was a majority (\>50%) of fishery dependent communities with 3 or
more high vulnerability ratings.

## Food Production Elements

### Commercial Fishing Production

**Description:**

This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and describes the risk
of not optimizing domestic commercial fishing production from
Council-managed species and total commercial fishing production in the
Mid-Atlantic. Commercial seafood landings , as well as total landings
which include bait, are used to assess fishing production.

**Definition:**

Risk of not optimizing total commercial fishing production.

**Indicators:**

Commercial seafood landings from Council managed species (in red below)
and total landings (in black) which include bait and industrial uses
were used to assess fishing production.

```{r, comm-landings, fig.asp=1.6, fig.cap ="Total commercial landings in the Mid-Atlantic Bight (black) and MAFMC-managed U.S seafood landings (red) by feeding guild, with significant declines (purple) in total planktivore landings and both total and MAFMC managed benthos landings and a significant increase (orange) in total benthivore landings."}

ecodata::plot_comdat(report = "MidAtlantic", plottype = "guild")

```

Time series of landings of bait from the Federal Commercial Dealer
Database.

**Potential risk criteria:**

The criteria still needs to be developed to account for both seafood and
total commercial landings.

### Recreational/Subsistence Food Production

**Description:**

This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and describes the risk
of not maintaining personal food production.

**Definition:**

Risk of not maintaining personal food production

**Indicators:**

Total recreational harvest (all species) and harvest per angler are
currently used as indicators in the Mid-Atlantic region. Recreational
seafood landings (as opposed to total catch which includes catch and
release that are captured under other Risk Elements/indicators) were
used to assess food use of recreationally caught fish.

The Ecosystem and Ocean Planning Committee and Advisory Panel also
supported the potential development of new indicators that would
evaluate the subsistence component of this risk element.

```{r, rec-landings, fig.cap ="Total recreational seafood harvest (millions of pounds, black, significant decrease, purple) in the Mid-Atlantic region."}
#, code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-recdat-landings.R")

ecodata::plot_recdat(report = "MidAtlantic", varName ="landings")
```

**Potential risk criteria:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             No trend or increase in recreational landings

  Low-Moderate    Increasing or high variability in recreational landings

  Moderate-High   Significant long term decrease in recreational landings

  High            Significant recent decrease in recreational landings
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Low risk was defined as no trend, or an increase in recreational seafood
landings. Low-Moderate risk was increasing or high variability in
recreational seafood landings. Moderate-High risk was a significant
long-term decrease in recreational seafood landings. High risk was a
significant recent decrease in recreational seafood landings.

## Management Elements

### Fishing Mortality Control

**Description:**

This element is applied at the species and sector (commercial and
recreational) level, and addresses the level of management control in
terms of catch estimation and monitoring to prevent overfishing.
Adequate management control indicates a low risk of overfishing, while
poor management control indicates a higher risk of overfishing and hence
not achieving OY.

The ability to control total catch within the specified Acceptable
Biological Catch (ABC) is necessary to prevent overfishing, which is a
fundamental requirement of US fisheries law. Chronic or persistent
overfishing can lead to stock depletion and ultimately to a stock being
declared as overfished and requiring a stock rebuilding plan. The
ability to constrain catch is a function of the efficacy of the catch
monitoring program for each species and sector which relies on both
proactive (in -season closure) and reactive (pay backs for overages in
subsequent years) accountability measures (AMs). Under certain
circumstances, specification of management measures which are too strict
could lead to "underfishing" (not achieving the desired quota) and hence
not achieving OY.

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY due to a mismatch of projected effects of
management controls with harvest/catch targets.

**Indicators:**

Total catch at the fishery sector level compared to the appropriate
catch limit (ABC or Annual Catch Limit, ACL). For the commercial
fishery, NMFS dealer data in conjunction with estimates of dead discards
from the most recent stock assessment are used to compare the annual
catch limit to actual annual catch. For the recreational sector, Marine
Recreational Information Program (MRIP) estimates of recreational
landings and dead discards in conjunction with stock assessment
estimates of recreational discards in weight are used to compare the
annual catch limit to actual annual catch estimates.

Landings only information could potentially be considered if
underfishing appears to be more important or if discards are low for a
fishery sector. Discards are also addressed under a separate risk
element. However, the current risk element is "Fishing Mortality
Control" which would include both landings and discards. The
Mid-Atlantic State of the Ecosystem report now includes an indicator
that looks at total catch divided by total ABC or ACL across all
Mid-Atlantic species if a broader look across managed species is
preferred.

```{r abcacl-stacked, fig.cap="Sum of catch limits across all MAFMC managed commercial (C) and recreational (R) fisheries.", fig.width = 6, fig.asp = 0.4}
#, code =  readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-abcacl-stacked.R")

ecodata::plot_abc_acl(report = "MidAtlantic", plottype = "Stacked")

```

```{r abcacl-catch, fig.cap = "Catch divided by ABC/ACL for MAFMC managed fisheries. High points are recreational black sea bass (up to 2021) and scup (2022). Red line indicates the median ratio across all fisheries."}
#, code =  readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-abcacl-catch.R")

ecodata::plot_abc_acl(report = "MidAtlantic", plottype = "Catch")

```

**Potential risk criteria:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             No recent history (last 5 years) of overages

  Low-Moderate    Small recent overages, but infrequent

  Moderate-High   Routine recent overages, but small to moderate

  High            Routine recent significant overages
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Technical Interactions

**Description:**

This element is applied at the species and sector (commercial and
recreational) level and considerers potential interactions with
non-Council-managed species, including protected species, on
Council-managed fisheries. Here the risk is caused by negative
consequences from fishing activity regulated under Council FMPs which
interacts with species managed by other agencies, including bycatch of
protected species. For example, interactions with species protected
under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) could result in
greater restrictions in Council managed fisheries, increasing the risk
that OY would not be achieved in those fisheries.

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY due to interactions with non-Council managed
species, including protected species.

**Indicators:**

The current indicator used is the MMPA category fishery level (Category
I - frequent incidental mortality or injury; Category II - occasional
incidental mortality or injury; Category III, remote likelihood of
incidental mortality or injury) assigned to the dominant gear type
associated with the fishery sector. This indicator is relatively static
over time and may not appropriately track risk associated with these
technical interactions.

Could look at the total number of protected species "takes" by a fishery
sector by year or five year period. Could also consider regulatory
changes that were considered and/or implemented to reduce technical
interactions in Mid-Atlantic fisheries.

**Proposed risk criteria:**

Evaluation of this risk element requires quantification of the
likelihood that non-Council AMs would be triggered and impact fishing
activities for Council managed species. In addition, NMFS manages
incidental mortality of mammals through take reductions plans which
could negatively impact a fishery.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             No interactions with non-Council managed species

  Low-Moderate    Interactions with non-Council managed species but
                  infrequent, Category II fishery under MMPA with limited
                  takes; or AMs not likely triggered

  Moderate-High   AMs in non-Council managed species may be triggered; or
                  Category I fishery under MMPA (but takes less than PBR)

  High            AMs in non-Council managed species triggered; or
                  Category I fishery under MMPA and takes above PBR

### Offshore Wind -- Biological/Ecosystem (new)

**Description:**

This element would be applied at the species level and considers the
biological and ecosystem risks of offshore wind development on
Council-managed fishery resources and/or the supporting habitat.
Offshore wind development is expected to cover 2.4 million acres of
ocean space by 2030 in the Greater Atlantic region (ME through NC).
Within these lease areas, there are 3,400 foundations (i.e., wind
turbines) with over 9,000 miles of interconnecting cable proposed for
construction. Offshore wind siting, construction, and operation has the
potential for a variety of biological impacts and associated risks for
fisheries resources. Habitat alteration, local hydrodynamic changes,
underwater noise, and electromagnetic fields (EMF) can affect stock
productivity, food availability and migration patterns. However, these
risks are likely different across species and habitat types and more
research is needed to fully understand these impacts.

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY due to biological impacts to stock
productivity, distribution, and ecosystem structure and function.

**Indicators:**

Information and relevant data at the species level available in the NOAA
Tech Memo titled "Fisheries and Offshore Wind Interactions: Synthesis of
Science".

Species distribution overlap with offshore wind from a couple of
potential data sources (e.g.,
<https://apps-st.fisheries.noaa.gov/dismap/DisMAP.html>). However,
translating exposure into a risk of impacts, which is likely to be
different by species, may be challenging.

From the State of the Ecosystem report - Right whale spatial overlap
with offshore wind lease areas to help inform the ecosystem
structure/function component of the definition.

evaluated the habitat usage by forage species within and outside of
offshore wind lease areas. This information could also be used to help
inform the ecosystem structure/function component of the definition.

### Offshore Wind -- Fishery Science and Access (new)

**Description:**

This element would be applied at the species and sector (commercial and
recreational) level and considers the risks of offshore wind development
on data and science quality and to fishery/fleet access for
Council-managed fishery resources. Given the anticipated overlap between
offshore wind lease areas and spatial coverage of many fishery-dependent
survey strata, there are anticipated survey impacts through "preclusion,
habitat change, changes in statistical design, and reduced sampling
productivity" (Hogan et al. 2023). These impacts to the quality and
quantity of the data could have implications for stock assessments,
scientific uncertainty, and catch levels. As wind turbine construction
and operation continues and expands, fishing fleet access, fishing
operations, and revenue are anticipated to change.

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY due to fishery impacts due to access and
scientific uncertainty.

**Indicators:**

Indicators for the Mid-Atlantic State of the Ecosystem and socioeconomic
impacts web site. Fishery revenue and party charter activity from within
lease areas by species, fleet, or community, community
vulnerability/engagement/EEJ, spatial overlap of lease areas and federal
fisheries surveys.

**Potential risk criteria:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             0-3% revenue in lease area; no/low EEJ concerns; 0-5%

  Low-Moderate    4-10% revenue in lease area; low-moderate EEJ concerns;
                  5-20% spatial overlap for relevant survey(s)

  Moderate-High   11-20% revenue in lease area; moderate-high EEJ
                  concerns; 21-40% spatial overlap for relevant survey(s)

  High            \>20% revenue in lease area; high EEJ concerns; \>40%

### Other Ocean Activities

**Description:**

This element is applied at the species and sector (commercial and
recreational) level, and addresses the risk of fishery displacement or
damage of a fishery resource and/or supporting habitat as a result of
non-fishing activities in the ocean (e.g., energy
development/aquaculture/shipping/other industrial uses, etc.). Many of
these activities are in planning stages but not yet implemented in the
region. It also includes evaluation of risk to Council fisheries from
area-based measures outside of the control of the Council, including
area closures implemented by other Councils to protect sensitive
habitats, spawning areas, etc. and/or through marine
monument/sanctuaries or other types of area-based management
designations.

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY due to fishery displacement from non-fishing
ocean activities and/or area designations.

**Indicators:**

A more quantitative approach (similar to that done for offshore wind)
could be applied with GIS mapping to determine the spatial footprint of
current and future planned non-fishing activities (if available) could
be calculated and qualify and spatial overlap with existing habitat
and/or fishing ground locations. With a quantitative evaluation,
potential to use a range/binned approach to specify risk level (e.g.,
0-10% overlap, low risk, 11-20% overlap, low-moderate risk etc.), but
those bins and risk level would likely be arbitrary. Depending on scope
of element and how applied, could use the NMFS Habitat Climate
Vulnerability Assessment, the Mid-Atlantic Council NRHA data explorer,
and the America the CCC Area-Based Management tool for spatial mapping
and overlap calculations.

**Potential risk criteria:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             No spatial overlap with fisheries

  Low-Moderate    Low-moderate overlap with fisheries

  Moderate-High   Moderate-high overlap with fisheries

  High            High overlap with fisheries; other uses could seriously
                  disrupt fishery prosecution
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Further refinement of the criteria will be needed to identify potential
thresholds to indicate a specific risk level.

**Risk Assessment**

Summarize ranking rationale

### Regulatory Complexity and Stability 

**Description:**

This element is applied at the species and sector (commercial and
recreational) level. Constituents have frequently raised concerns about
the complexity and continually changing fishery regulations and the need
to simplify them to improve their efficacy. Complex and constantly
changing regulations may lead to non-compliance and/or impact other
fisheries. Non-compliance could have stock assessment, data quality,
management, and fairness and equity implications.

**Revised definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY due to frequency of regulatory modifications
and regulatory complexity, which may have an adverse effect on
compliance.

**Indicators:**

Continue with a qualitative evaluation using the frequency of any
regulatory change over the last 5 years by fishery and sector.

Potential alternative indicators include: quantifying the number of
regulations and/or the frequency of regulatory changes, based on
evaluation of the Code of Federal Regulations; frequency of mid-changes;
number of states in management unit with different regulations
(recreational bluefish versus black sea bass for example); noncompliant
harvest relative to total harvest reported by MRIP to track compliance.

**Potential risk criteria:**

Risk levels and definitions will need to be updated depending upon the
indicators developed for this risk element.

**Risk Assessment**

Summarize ranking rationale

### Allocation

**Description:**

Many Mid-Atlantic fisheries have some allocation component and any
adjustments/changes in allocation can be driven by a number of factors
which can present a variety of management, biological, and fishery
risks. This element is applied at the species and sector level, and
addresses the risk of not achieving OY due to spatial mismatch of stocks
and management allocations or because of sub-optimal allocation by
sector and/or area.

**Definition:**

Risk of not achieving OY due to spatial mismatch of stocks and
management or sub-optimal allocation by sector and/or area.

**Indicators:**

Currently, the Allocation indicator consists of whether or not the
Council is considering or an ongoing management action that might have
any sort of allocation outcome/implication (by sector, region, permit
holder etc.). However, this indicator does not directly get at the
actual risk associated with spatial mis-match or sub-optimal allocation.

Indicators quantifying the difficulty of allocation could include a
combination of distribution shifts (see above) and the number of
interests (sectors, states, etc.) requiring allocation. There are new
analyses and tools available (Palacios-Abrentes et al 2023
-<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279025>) that could provide more
insight on actual mismatch risks for some species and sectors.

**Potential risk criteria:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             No recent or ongoing Council discussion about
                  allocation

  Low-Moderate    *This category not used*

  Moderate-High   *This category not used*

  High            Recent or ongoing Council discussion about allocation
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, there are no definitions to specify intermediate levels of
risk for this element, so only low and high risk criteria have been
developed. A Low risk ranking was no recent or ongoing Council
discussion about allocation. High risk was defined as recent or ongoing
Council discussion about allocation.

**Risk Assessment**

Summarize ranking rationale

### Discards

**Description:**

This element is applied at the species and sector level. Stakeholders
have identified the reduction of discards as a high priority in the
Council management program, especially those caused by regulations since
they represent biological and economic waste. Discards of either the
target or non-target species in the fishery would be taken into
consideration.

**Definition:**

Risk of not minimizing regulatory discards, bycatch mortality, and
incidental catch to extent practicable.

**Indicators:**

NMFS provides estimates of discards by species based, in large part, on
at-sea observations collected in the Northeast Fisheries Observer
Program (NEFOP), for stock assessment purposes and quota monitoring. The
observer program provides information on the reason for discarding
during a commercial trip. In addition, the MRIP provides estimate of
discards by species for the recreational fisheries. Discards and
incidental catch will be evaluated for each species and fishery with a
focus on identifying discards caused by regulations for each fishery
sector. The ratio of regulatory discards to total discards for the
target species could be applied or the ratio of discards to overall
catch of the target species could be applied. A similar, or combined,
approach could be applied for non-target species.

Discard mortality indicators might be more challenging, at least in
terms of tracking improvements/declines over time. Discard mortality
rates by species and gear type are not estimated annually, or even every
10 years, and are typically based on results developed from targeted
research projects. Therefore, a static discard mortality rate by species
and gear is applied to the discard estimate.

**Potential risk criteria:**

Low risk was defined as no significant discards and incidental catch
(\<5%). Low-Moderate risk was low or episodic discarding and incidental
catch (\<20%). Moderate-High risk was regular discarding and incidental
catch (20% or more) but managed at an acceptable level. High risk was
high discarding and incidental catch (\>40%) and difficulty in
management. A similar approach could be applied to discard mortality
risks: low - mortality \<5% for dominant gear; low-moderate - mortality
\<25% for dominant gear; moderate-high - mortality \<50% for dominant
gear; mortality \>50% for dominant gear.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Risk Level*    *Definition*
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Low             No significant discards or incidental catch; no
                  significant discard mortality

  Low-Moderate    Low or episodic discards and incidental catch; low
                  discard mortality

  Moderate-High   Regular discards and incidental catch but managed;
                  moderate discard mortality

  High            High discards and incidental catch, difficult to
                  manage; high discard mortality.
