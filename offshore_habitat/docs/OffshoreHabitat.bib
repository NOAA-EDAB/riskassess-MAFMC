	abstract = {Cruises were made off Chesapeake Bight from December 1959 through April 1963 to determine species composition and distribution of fishes spawned on the Continental Shelf. Illustrations of young fish, herein provided, now complete figures from newly hatched larvae to juveniles. Verbal descriptions provide prominent features of young bluefish to aid in identification and osteological development and to compare similar appearing larvae. Bluefish larvae can be distinguished from similar appearing species (Peprilus triacanthus and Urophycis chuss) with which they were taken in Chesapeake Bight by myomere numbers and pigment patterns. Bluefish larvae closely resemble the larval scombrids, Scomber scombrus and S. japonicus, and larval carangids. They may be separated by myomere numbers or relative lengths of the preopercular spine. Continental Shelf waters off the Virginia-North Carolina coast are major spawning grounds of bluefish. Major spawning sites in the Chesapeake Bight were located over the outer half of the shelf between 55 km (30 nautical mi) and 148 km (80 nautical mi) offshore and where water temperatures were 22 C or greater and surface salinities were 31‰ or greater. Minimum temperature at the onset of spawning was 18 C and minimum salinity was 26.6\%. Our data show that bluefish spawning commences in June, peaks in July, and continues into August. Peak spawning activity occurred in early evening near sundown (1900-2100 hr). Eggs are thought to be transported south and offshore by prevailing surface currents. Larval bluefish inhabit surface waters and greatest numbers were found near the edge of the Continental Shelf. Juvenile bluefish move inshore during their first growing season. Despite intensive sampling, none were captured in offshore waters. We speculate that with growth young bluefish move to depths above the thermocline. We suspect that the most important single factor in determining the fate of every year class is the circulation of Continental Shelf waters.},

	abstract = {Overwintering conditions have long been known to affect fish survival and year-class strength as well as determine the poleward range limit of many temperate fishes. Despite this known importance, mechanisms controlling overwintering mortality are poorly understood and the tolerance of marine fishes to the combined effects of winter temperature, salinity, and size is rarely quantified. In recent years, higher abundances of the temperate Serranid, black sea bass Centropristis striata, have been observed at latitudes further north than their traditional range suggesting that warming water temperatures, particularly during winter, may be facilitating the establishment of a population at more northern latitudes. To examine overwintering survival of C. striata, the combined effects of temperature, salinity and body mass were quantified in laboratory experiments. We identified 6°C as the lower incipient lethal temperature for C. striata, below which fish cease feeding, lose weight rapidly and die within 32 days. A short cold exposure experiment indicated that temperatures below 5°C resulted in mortality events that continued even as the temperature increased slowly to 10°C, indicating that even short cold snaps can impact survival and recruitment in this species. Importantly, fish in lower salinity lived significantly longer than fish at higher salinity at both 3°C and 5°C, suggesting that osmoregulatory stress plays a role in overwintering mortality in this species. Size was not a critical factor in determining overwintering survival of young-of-the-year (YOY) C. striata. Overwintering survival of YOY C. striata can be effectively predicted as a function of temperature and salinity and their interaction with an accelerated failure model to project future range limits. Identifying temperature thresholds may be a tractable way to incorporate environmental factors into population models and stock assessment models in fishes.},

	abstract = {Black sea bass (Centropristis striata) migrations are believed to play a role in overwinter survival and connectivity between juvenile and adult populations. This study investigated oceanographic drivers of winter habitat choice and regional differences between populations of juvenile and adult black sea bass. Trends in cohort strength, as a result of juvenile survival, were also identified. Oceanographic and fisheries survey data were analyzed using generalized additive models. Among the oceanographic variables investigated, salinity was the main driver in habitat selection with an optimal range of 33–35 practical salinity units (PSU) for both juveniles and adults. Preferred temperature ranges varied between juveniles and adults, but held a similar minimum preference of {\textgreater}8°C. Salinity and temperature ranges also differed by regions north and south of Hudson Canyon. Shelf water volume had less of an effect than temperature or salinity, but showed an overall negative relationship with survey catch. The effect of winter conditions on juvenile abundance was also observed across state and federal survey index trends. A lack of correlation observed among surveys in the fall paired with a strong correlation in the spring identifies the winter period as a factor determining year-class strength of new recruits to the population. A rank order analysis of spring indices identified three of the largest year classes occurring during years with reduced shelf water volumes, warmer winter shelf waters, and a 34 PSU isohaline aligned farther inshore. While greater catches of black sea bass in the northwest Atlantic Ocean remain south of Hudson Canyon, the species’ range has expanded north in recent years.},

	abstract = {Unlike many temperate marine species that alter spatial or depth distributions in response to environmental change, tilefish (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps) has such specific habitat requirements that off the coast of New England, USA, it is restricted to the normally warm-water, upper continental shelf slope, where it excavates and occupies burrows. In 1882, tens of millions of adult tilefish died suddenly following the intrusion of lethally cold Subarctic water into the tilefish habitat. Here we show that the same climate driver implicated in the 1882 event (the North Atlantic Oscillation: NAO) has also affected commercial tilefish landings throughout most of the 20th century by altering slope water temperatures and likely the tilefish's reproductive success. We also show that this temperature–landings relationship broke down in the 1970s coincident with dramatically increased exploitation. Reconstructions of decadal to millennial scale variations in slope water temperatures explain why no mass mortality occurred following the 2010 negative NAO anomaly, despite being similar in magnitude to the NAO anomaly that preceded the 1882 event.},

	abstract = {We made forty-one submersible dives along the outer continental shelf in the Mid-Atlantic-southern New England region to study tilefish distribution, abundance, habitat and behavior, and the strueture of the community associated with tilefish habitats. Tilefish are shelter seeking and inhabit three more or less distinct habitats: (1) horizontal excavations in clay outcrops along the walls of submarine canyons (pueblo habitats); (2) scour depressions under rocks and boulders and; (3) the primary habitat, funnel-shaped vertical burrows in horizontal clay substrates. There appear to be two critical habitat requirements, relatively warm (9–14±C) stable bottom temperatures and the availability of shelter or a malleable sustrate in which to construct a shelter. Suitable substrate for burrowing is usually provided by clay that is frequently exposed around submarine canyons. At least some vertical burrows were seen at most dive locations within the stud) area except at Norfolk Canyon. Pueblo and boulder habitats were mostly associated with submarine canyons off New England, and excavations under rock slabs were occupied in Baltimore Canyon. Vertical burrows occurred from 80–305m, but where vertical burrow and other habitats co-occurred, burrows were in shallower water ({\textless}120m). Vertical burrows were contagiously distributed, and significantly larger and more dense at the Mid-Atlantic dive sites than off New England (mean diameter and density = 1.6 m and 1234 per km2 at Hudson Canyon. 0.88 m and 624 per km2 at Veatch Canyon and 0.88m and 145 per km2 at Lydonia Canyon). Various crustaceans (e.g. Munida spp., Cancer sp., and goneplacid crabs) and fishes (e.g. Conger oceanicus, Anthias spp., Urophycis sp. and Helicolenus dactyhpterus) were more abundant in than awaj from burrows. Many species either live in or around the tilefish burrow so that the upper margin oi the burrow is honey-combed by their secondary burrowing. We believe burrows are formed by a combination of oral excavation by tilefish, secondary bioerosion by associated species, and tilefish swimming motions to flush fine sediment from the burrow. Tilefish appeared to orient to particular vertical burrows, and time lapse photography showed that fish may pair in burrows. Noncorresponding, temporal activity patterns of tilefish and associated species may indicate that predation by tilefish is a strong organizing principle in the community associated with tilefish burrows.},
